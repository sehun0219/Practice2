//DESCRIPTION:
//Can you find the needle in the haystack?

//Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

//After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

//"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

//Example(Input-- > Output)

//["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"]-- > "found the needle at position 5"
//Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

using System;


public class Kata
{
    public static string FindNeedle(object[] haystack)
    {
        //return $"found the needle at position {Array.IndexOf(haystack, "needle")}";
        string result = "found the needle at position ";
        for (int i = 0; i < haystack.Length; i++)
        {
            if (haystack[i] == "needle")
            {
                result += i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
